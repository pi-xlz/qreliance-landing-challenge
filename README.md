# qreliance-landing-challenge

This project was an internship challenge/task. It's a website with all textual content stripped from https://qreliance.com.ng/.

We were  challenged to create a landing page from scratch using the site(https://qreliance.com.ng/) as a guide. Thus all the text-related content were stripped
from the aforementioned website.

Technologies used in this project are as follows:
- React.js
- CSS Modules

The site is mobile responsive(I basically targeted mobile and desktop, sorry Ipad geeks).

This site was deployed using Netlify and is live at https://quickselar-challenge.netlify.app/.

#### Peace.
